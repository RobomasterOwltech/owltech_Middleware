This repo contains all the necessary low-levelish software to communicate the STM32 HAL and application code for FreeRTOS, controlling Robomaster and some Gobilda hardware. 

# NOTES:

If you were to change the C/C++ standard used, remember to change it in the `IntelliSense`, `makefile`, and `c_cpp_propperties.json`
